Fluorescence spectroscopy applies to those who can emit fluorescence or could generate fluorescent complex with other reagents. Compared with absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy has higher sensitivity and better selectivity. But its application range is not as wide as absorption spectroscopy.

用于检测自身可以发射荧光或者可与其它试剂形成荧光络合物的物质。相比吸收光谱的分析，荧光分析灵敏度更高，选择性更好。但应用范围不如吸收光谱法广。
