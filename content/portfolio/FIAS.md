Essentially it is  a spectrophotometer. It is modular designed and use computer to control the whole process from sample digestion, reaction to signal detection. It works well where the amount of testing needed is very high.  We have modules for total phosphorous, total nitrogen, orthophosphate, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite.

其实质是分光光度计。采用模块化设计，由计算机控制实现样品的全过程分析，包括样品消解，化学反应，信号检测等。适合大批量样品的检测，我系拥有的模块可进行总磷，总氮，正磷，氨氮，硝氮及亚硝氮的分析。
