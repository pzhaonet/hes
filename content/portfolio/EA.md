用于样品中碳，氢，氮，硫含量的测定。样品在高温完全燃烧，经进一步还原，通过色谱柱分离后由热导检测器检测。
It is used for the precise determination of C, H, N and S. Samples will be fully combusted at high temperature and both organic and inorganic substances are converted into elemental gases which,  after further reduction, are separated in a chromatographic column and finally detected by a highly sensitive thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
